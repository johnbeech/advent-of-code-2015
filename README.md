# Advent of Code 2015

My solutions for Advent of Code 2015.

## Setup

Clone this repo, then run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Running

To run a solution by day, use:
```
node dayX/solution.js
````

## Account Merging

This code was originally written using my `Markavian` github account up to Day 15. I've transferred the repo here to `johnbeech`, with the intent to reenter and resubmit my solutions for the 2015 stars, with the intent to complete the remaining days of the challenge.s
